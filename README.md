# 📊 AtliQ Ad-hoc SQL Insights  

## 📝 Project Overview  
AtliQ Hardwares—India’s leading computer hardware maker with global reach—needed fast, data-backed answers to 10 ad-hoc business questions. I stepped in as a data analyst, wrote validated MySQL queries, analyzed results, and delivered executive-ready insights in Power BI.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Write efficient SQL queries to solve 10 ad-hoc requests.  
- Derive actionable insights from raw transactional data.  
- Communicate results clearly for leadership decision-making.  
- Present insights in a **management-ready presentation**.

## 🗂️ Dataset & Metadata  
Provided by **Codebasics** (imaginary AtliQ Hardwares dataset).  
Key tables include:  
- `dim_customer` → customer details (region, market, channel, etc.)  
- `dim_product` → product attributes (division, segment, variant, etc.)  
- `fact_sales_monthly` → monthly sales quantity per product & customer  
- `fact_gross_price` → product gross price by year  
- `fact_manufacturing_cost` → product cost details  
- `fact_pre_invoice_deductions` → customer-level discount data

## ❓ Ad-hoc Business Requests (Q1–Q10)  
1. Markets where **AtliQ Exclusive** operates in **APAC**.  
2. % increase in **unique products** in 2021 vs 2020.  
3. **Unique product counts by segment**.  
4. Segment with the **highest increase** in unique products (2021 vs 2020).  
5. Products with **highest & lowest manufacturing costs**.  
6. **Top-5 customers** by average **pre-invoice discount %** in FY2021 (India).  
7. Monthly **gross sales** for **AtliQ Exclusive**.  
8. **Quarter of 2020** with maximum **sold quantity**.  
9. **Channel** contributing most to gross sales in FY2021 (with % share).  
10. **Top-3 products** by sold quantity in each division (FY2021).

## 📈 Key Insights 
- AtliQ increased its unique product portfolio by ~36.33% in FY2021 (from 245 → 334 SKUs).

- Retailer channel drove the majority of gross sales in FY2021 (~69% share).

- Accessories saw the highest product expansion in 2021 (+34 unique products vs. 2020; Notebooks/Peripherals +16 each).

- Several Indian customers received very high average pre-invoice discounts (~29–31%), e.g., Flipkart (~30.8%), Viveks (~30.4%), Croma (~30.3%), Ezone (~30.3%), Amazon (~29.3%)—a potential margin risk
