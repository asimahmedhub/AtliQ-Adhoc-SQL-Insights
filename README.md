📊 AtliQ Ad-hoc SQL Insights
📝 Project Overview

This project is part of the Codebasics Resume Projects.
I step into the role of a junior data analyst at AtliQ Hardwares — one of the leading computer hardware producers in India with global expansion.

The management team needed quick, data-informed insights for 10 ad-hoc business requests.
To showcase SQL and storytelling skills, I wrote queries in MySQL, analyzed the results, and presented actionable insights tailored for top-level management.

🎯 Objectives

Write efficient SQL queries to solve 10 ad-hoc requests.

Derive actionable insights from raw transactional data.

Communicate results clearly for leadership decision-making.

Present insights in a management-ready presentation.
